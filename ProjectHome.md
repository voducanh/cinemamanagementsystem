The system will be designed to allow the easy management of a series of movies and cinema screens for a multiplex. Data on viewing figures, attributes of films and also information about each screen will be stored as historical data. These will then be available to the user(s) on request.

The system will include and automated rotation system that identifies the popularity of movies based on viewing figures and re-arranges films and screens to allow maximise the profitability of releases.

The system will also feature a marketing and promotional system that will identify poorly performing films and suggest appropriate marketing strategies and also a system to promote major film releases that may be of interest to customers.
The cinema already has a booking system so this functionality is not required, however the system must be able to link in data from bookings and store information on this as historical data.
